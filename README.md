# ft_containers
This project aim to reimplement the following C++ containers:
- [x] Vector ([std::vector])
- [x] Set ([std::set])
- [x] Stack ([std::stack])
- [x] Map ([std::map])

STL is not allowed. That means you the project doesn't use `<iterator>` or even `<utility>`.

This implementation comes with a large set of tests in the test directory.
